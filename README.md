# Angular-Google API integration with RXJS

A project that demonstrates the integration of google API and Angular along with RXJS

The api file,api-key.ts has the api key section empty (since its private) and need to be updated with the google api key from the below link

https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview

You just need to use your google account to sign in and you can retrieve your API Key.

Google Custom Search JSON API provides 100 search queries per day for free

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
